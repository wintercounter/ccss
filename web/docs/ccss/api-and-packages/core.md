The core of **CCSS** and APIs for extending it with new features. Includes support for all CSS properties.

## Exports

### `ccss` (default export)

Awaits a style object and returns a CSS string. Not registered keys will be ignored by default.

```js
import ccss from 'ccss'
```

```js live
ccss({
    display: 'f'
})
```

### `createCCSS(defaultOptions?)`

Create a custom **CCSS** function with your own configuration. Calling this in most cases is completely
unnecessary, it's only needed if you want to use multiple CCSS instances at once.

```js
import { createCCSS } from '@cryptic-css/core'

const ccss = createCCSS()
```

## Options

### `applyUnit`

A function that's being called with number values to apply a certain unit.

It receives the value as an argument, and it should return the desired output.

```js
ccss.setOptions({
    applyUnit: x => `${x}cm`
})
```

> All other [transformed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/transformed) options are available.
